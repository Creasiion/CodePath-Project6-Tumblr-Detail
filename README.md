# Project 6 - *Tumblr UX*

Submitted by: **Imani Cage**

**Tumblr UX** is an app that adds on to the previous edition of my Tumblr project (see here: https://github.com/Creasiion/CodePath-project5-Tumblr), and adds the ability for users to navigate to a detail view by tapping a blog post in the main tumblr feed.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Setup navigation to the Detail Screen
- [x] Created the Detail View UI
- [x] Add the ability to pass data to the Detail View Controller
- [x] Made personal finishing touches to the UI


## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

- I hope to later figure out how I can personalize the navigation bar! I think when moving into the post details, the navigation bar title is too hard, which is bad for accodations and just doesn't look appealing in the first place!
